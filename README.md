# SeedScan
Python program that searches files for partial or full BIP39 recovery seed words.

*****************

TO DO:

1. Integrate with Chris Cohen's BTCScan - https://gist.github.com/chriswcohen/7e28c95ba7354a986c34
   - The core SeedScan functionality could be embedded within BTCScan for simultaneous searching of bitcoin addresses, keys        and seeds.
   - Options for the user should be added to switch on/off this functionality.
   
2. Add functionality for searching Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and PDF files.

3. Consider adding OCR functionality to allow for identification of recovery seeds stored as screenshots and photographs.

4. Review all available options to increase performance considering the potential overhead of points 2 and 3.
